# Atlantic Coastal Islands using Sentinel 2 Imagery
Created by Anneke van der Laan for EPM GIS in March and April 2023, under https://github.com/annekecvdl/epm_contract/tree/main (V.1.5). 
Edited by Leah Fulton in May 2023 (V.1.6).

This project uses the CoastSat open-source software toolkit (version 2.1) to extract the coastline of input areas from Sentintel-2 satellite imagery.

There are two Python scripts for this process:

There are two Python scripts for this process:
1.	Prepare_GeoJSON.py - Extracts the coastline from Sentinel-2 imagery using the CoastSat toolkit resulting in a number of GeoJSON polyline files.*
2.	Process_GeoJSON.py - Processes the output GeoJSON files from Prepare_GeoJSON.py using ArcPy to create a single polyline Feature Class of the extracted coastline result.

Prepare_GeoJSON.py was duplicated for each province and customized based on their polygon attributes and is renamed as follows:
- `Prepare_GeoJSON_NFLD.py`
- `Prepare_GeoJSON_PEI.py`
- `Prepare_GeoJSON_NB.py`
- `Prepare_GeoJSON_QC.py`

### At this stage, `Prepare_GeoJSON_NFLD.py` and `Prepare_GeoJSON_PEI.py` require review. From step #1 to #4 outlines the methodology and associated direction, while Step #5 outlines further improvement and recommendations to be reviewed.

## 1 - SET UP
Before the scripts can be run, there are a number of set up steps that need to be performed.

### 1.1 - CLONE THIS REPO LOCALLY
Before starting, make sure to clone this repository locally by following these steps: [How to clone a GitHub repository.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?tool=cli)

The project consists of two main parts. In the first part, when preparing the GeoJSON, you'll need to set up the CoastSat toolkit along with other required packages. In the second part, when processing the GeoJSON into Feature Classes, you'll need the ArcPy package.

If you plan to run only one part of the project, you can focus on setting up the dependencies for that specific half. Please note that installing ArcPy in an Anaconda environment might be challenging. If you encounter difficulties, consider running the `Prepare_GeoJSON.py` script in your Anaconda environment and the `Process_GeoJSON.py` script in your normal shell for a smoother experience.

### 1.2 - SET UP AN ANACONDA ENVIRONMENT

An Anaconda environment is required to run `Prepare_GeoJSON.py`.

This part of the set-up is almost entirely copied (but simplified) from the CoastSat installation instructions. They include more details about the Anaconda, GitHub, Google Earth Engine (GEE), and CoastSat installation instructions. [Here is their installation guide.](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat) 

#### If this is your first time using the program:
1. Download and install **Anaconda**. [Download Anaconda here.](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
2. Open **Anaconda Navigator** and launch a **Powershell Prompt**.
3. Run `conda install gh --channel conda-forge` to download the Git CLI. Set up the CLI. [Here is a Git CLI quickstart.](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/quickstart)
4. Download **Git for Windows**.
5. Clone the **CoastSat 2.1** repository locally using `gh repo clone kvos/CoastSat`.
6. Navigate to the cloned repository.
7. Create an Anaconda environment named `coastsat` with required packages installed by running the following commands:
      ```
      conda create -n coastsat python=3.8
      conda activate coastsat
      conda install -c conda-forge geopandas earthengine-api scikit-image matplotlib astropy notebook -y
      pip install pyqt5
      ```
8. Link environment to GEE server. `earthengine authenticate --auth_mode=notebook`

#### If you have been here before:
1. Open **Anaconda Navigator** and launch a **Powershell Prompt**.
2. Navigate to the cloned repository.
3. Activate the CoastSat profile. `conda activate coastsat` 
4. Ensure your GEE token is not expired. `earthengine authenticate --auth_mode=notebook`

### 1.3 - MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ARCPY SET UP

ArcPy is required to run `Process_GeoJSON.py`.

If you would like to install ArcPy in the same Anaconda environment, you can do if you are in an activated conda environment and run `conda install arcpy=3.1 -c esri` [Instructions to install ArcPy are here.](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/get-started/installing-arcpy.htm)

As previously mentioned, I had troubles installing ArcPy in Anaconda, so I ran the Process_GeoJSON.py script in a regular shell outside of Anaconda. You can do this, or if you have ArcGIS Pro installed, it is likely already installed on your hardware â€“ however, ArcGIS Pro environment will not allow to manipulate or modify the default environment, so you need to clone the default environment and activate a new environment. 

1.	Right click on Python Command Prompt, and open File location
2.	Run as Administer
3.	Paste into scratch and fill `conda create --name myclone --clone myenv`
Ex: `conda create --name arcgispropy3_clone --clone arcgispro-py3`

### 1.4 - PREPARE POLYGON COORDINATES
The provided example is specific to Newfoundland, but the preparation has been done for all Atlantic Canadian provinces, including New Brunswick, P.E.I., and Quebec.
The polygons in `Newfoundland_Fishnet_Polygon_Points.csv` are prepared for Newfoundland. If you intend to run the program on a different area, you'll need to create a similar file specific to that region.
To create a fishnet over your area of interest, ensure that each square in the fishnet does not exceed 100 square kilometers (10 kilometers by 10 kilometers).

### 1.5 - PREPARE THE SUBSET OF POLYGONS TO PROCESS
In the area to be processed, there are distinct regions with clear satellite imagery from various dates. I extensively explored Sentinel-2 imagery results using Google Earth Engine (GEE) for different regions around Newfoundland. As a result, I created a polygon layer that divides the province into these distinct areas. However, the task of associating a date and ID with each polygon in the layer is pending and needs to be completed.

This particular aspect of the process requires significant improvement. Currently, the triage of polygons into different areas is done manually, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Enhancing this step will streamline the process, leading to more accurate and efficient results.

### 1.6 - EXPORT POLYGONS TO POINTS
To organize the fishnet polygons by the date of satellite imagery, follow these steps:

1. Add a new field called "Date" as a Text field type to the Newfoundland Polygons by Date feature. Use Select by Location, with the input feature being the fishnet polygons and the selecting features being the Newfoundland Polygons by Date. This will highlight the fishnet polygons that intersect with each polygon date. Open the attribute table, click on "Calculate Field," and insert the corresponding date (e.g., "October 19, 2019") for each highlighted fishnet polygon. The result will only highlight the populated field. Repeat this process for all dates.
2. In the geoprocessing pane, open the "Feature Vertices to Point" tool, using the fishnet with the associated polygon dates as the input feature.
3. Add two fields, "X" and "Y," with a Double field type to the new layer. Save the changes. Left-click on the new fields and choose "Calculate Geometry" to obtain the X and Y coordinates in Decimal Degrees for each point.
4. Export the polygons to a CSV file, where each row represents one point. Each row should include the shape ID of the point (indicating which polygon it belongs to), along with the corresponding X and Y coordinates. Refer to `Newfoundland_Fishnet_Polygon_Points.csv` for an example of how the CSV file should be structured. Ensure that the first shape ID is assigned as 0.

## 2 - RUNNING THE SCRIPT TO PREPARE THE GEOJSON
To run the script, make sure you have run the above set up steps in an Anaconda shell and that you are navigated to the cloned repo folder containing the `Prepare_GeoJSON.py` script and run `python .\Prepare_GeoJSON.py`. Make sure the `Prepare_GeoJSON.py` script in the coastsat folder. 

### 2.1 - USER INPUTS
The user will be asked for many inputs. If no input is provided, a default value for that input is used. The default value is displayed to the user for each input. The inputs are as follows:
1. `POLYGON LIST CSV PATH`: The path to `Newfoundland_Fishnet_Polygon_Points.csv` that you downloaded and moved to the CoastSat folder.
2. `SENTINTEL-2 IMAGE DATE`: The date that you would like to download images for.
3. `SATELLITE LIST`: The list of satellites used to filter the satellite imagery from GEE. The input can be any subset of the following list of satellites: `['L5','L7','L8','L9','S2']`
4. `COLLECTION`: Indication to use collection 1 `'C01'` or collection 2 `'C02'`. It is recommended to use collection 2. 
5. `FOLDER NAME`: The name of the folder to store the downloaded images. (A good name would describe the area being processed.)
6. `DOWNLOAD IMAGES FROM GEE`: If you are running the program for the input folder name from step 1.6 with the current inputs for the first time, input `YES` to download the images from GEE. If you have already run the program for that folder name and the current input settings, input `NO` to use the images that have already been downloaded.
7. `SAVE JPGS`: If you would like to save an additional JPG image during processing input `YES`. This is useful if you would like to go inspect the image results of the program when it is finished running. These JPGs are not necessary for the program to run. If you don't need them, input `NO` to skip saving JPGs.

### 2.2 - LOGGING
As the program runs, it will keep track of how many polygons have run successfully as well as a list of any polygons that encountered errors. At the end of the program, the list of polygon IDs that errored will be printed to the console as well as the total run time of the program, the total processing time of the polygons, and the number of successful polygons. There are also logging and update messages that are printed throughout the processing to indicate the status and progress of the program as it runs.

### 2.3 - OUTPUTS
The outputs of this program are a number of GeoJSON files stored in the folder that was indicated by the user when the program ran. There is one GeoJSON polyline file for each input polygon.

### 2.4 - NOTES ON ERRORS
This program is not perfect or robust enough in its error/exception handling. If you are trying to run the program and having probleams, here is a common list of things to check first:
- Is the `Prepare_GeoJSON.py` script saved in the top level CoastSat folder?
- Is the points CSV file that you are using storing the correct data in the correct order? Is the file stored in the right place?
- When running the program to download GEE images, is there already a folder in `CoastSat/data` with the folder name that you are using in this program run that already contains data that you are trying to download?
- When running the program to use local images that have already been downloaded, have the images already been downloaded? Are they already in a folder in `CoastSat/data` with a matching folder name?
- If you used any custom user input values, are they formatted correctly and valid?
- Is the `coastsat` profile enabled in the Anaconda shell terminal?
- Do you need to renew the GEE token?

## 3.0 - EXPLORE THE GEOJSON RESULTS
The results of Prepare_GeoJSON.py can be explored before further processing.

### 3.1 - OPEN IN QGIS
To explore the results in the GeoJSON files easily, follow these steps using QGIS:

1. Open QGIS and create a new project, then add a basemap to provide context to your data. You can refer to a walkthrough on how to add a basemap to a QGIS project.
2. Import the resulting GeoJSON files into the project to visualize the processed data. Each GeoJSON file represents a single polyline for each processed polygon.
3. Keep in mind that the current GeoJSON results may contain connected line segments, resulting in additional lines that need to be removed. This implies that some post-processing work is required to clean up the data and eliminate these extra lines, ensuring accurate representation.

By following these steps, you can conveniently explore and visualize the results of the GeoJSON files in QGIS. Remember to perform the necessary post-processing steps to ensure the data is free from any unwanted connected line segments.

### 3.2 - GOOD RESULTS
Most of the results are very successful and outline the islands, shore, and lakes accurately at a 1:10,000 scale.

### 3.3 - BAD RESULTS - BUSY IMAGES
Certain polygons in the results exhibit undesirable outcomes. During the analysis, I observed instances where a polygon contained an additional JPEG downloaded as a subset of the original area. Unfortunately, this subset was filled with points due to cloud cover. To address this issue, an investigation of these polygons is necessary to remove the extraneous images. The solution involves modifying a combination of the CoastSat settings and user inputs.

### 3.4 - BAD RESULTS - MISSING RESULTS
Certain areas of the original polygon fishnet are completely missing in the results, raising concerns about data gaps. Despite starting with a perfect grid of squares as the input fishnet, the results appear to deviate slightly from the original squares, forming diagonal lines in specific sections. This discrepancy has led to missing data in those areas. To address this issue, a comprehensive investigation is essential to identify the root cause of the missing data. The investigation will focus on understanding why these discrepancies and data gaps occur.

### 3.5 - BAD RESULTS - IMAGE BOUNDARIES
For some of the results, there is a straight line that is created that is unrelated to the coastline. I found that these lines are caused by lighter lines along the edges of the images downloaded from GEE. Because there is a lighter edge around some of the borders of some of the images, the coastline detection process sees these changes in colour as changes between water and land and identify the areas as coastline when they are not. This is an issue because these line segments are not part of the coastline and will cause issues when trying to merge all of the coastlines together. I'm not sure the correct approach to solve this problem. One option could be to address the lightness in the images during processing by changing some of the CoastSat code itslef to not process the image pixels around the border. This could cause some problems though by missing legitamite coastline data that is along the edges. However, this could be solved by overlapping the polygons of the fishnet a little bit to account for the edges that would not be considered. This solution would have to be explored more to verify that it would work. Another option would be to clean up the coastline extracted in post-processing. Investigation would need to be done to see if there is a tool that can detect straight points in order to isolate the areas that need to be removed. There could also be another aproach to find these line segments. Another option would be to remove these lines manually, but this would be the most time consuming approach.

## 4 - RUNNING THE SCRIPT TO PROCESS THE GEOJSON
To run the script, navigate to the cloned repo folder containing the `Process_GeoJSON.py` script and run `python .\Process_GeoJSON.py`. Note that I had problems setting up an environment in Anaconda that would allow me to use ArcPy, but to make it work in tandem in an Anaconda Shell, you need to clone the arcgispro-py3 environment. You cannot modify the default Pythonenvironmnent (`arcgispro-py3`), so you must clone and activiate a new environment.  
1. If ArcGIS Pro is installed on your computer, you have a python command promnpt. Right click on the python command prompt, and open file location. 
2. Run as Administrator
3. Run `conda create --name myclone --clone myenv` , but replace `myclone` with your environment clone name, and replace `myenv` with your enviroinment that you are cloning. 

### 4.1 - USER INPUTS
The user will be asked for many inputs. If no input is provided, a default value for that input is used. The default value is displayed to the user for each input. The inputs are as follows:
1. `FOLDER NAME`: The name to use for the output results. It is recommended to use the same name as the GeoJSON folder, but it is not required.
2. `GEOJSON FOLDER PATH`: The path of the folder containing the GeoJSON files to process.
3. `GEO DATABASE PATH`: The path of the geodatabase where the resulting Feature Classes will be created.

### 4.2 - GEOJSON PROCESSING
1. First, a Feature Class is created for every input GeoJSON file using the JSON to Features tool. The name of each Feature Class is <FOLDER_NAME>_<NUMBER> where the folder name is the name input by the user and the number is extracted from the processed GeoJSON file name which represents the polygon number. The resulting Feature Classes are then merged together using the Merge tool. The name of the merged Feature Class is <FOLDER_NAME>_MERGE.
2. The merged Feature Class is then split using the Split Line tool to create multiple line segments along the vertices. The name of the output line Feature Class is <FOLDER_NAME>_SPLIT.
The next step is to remove the long line segments that connect different pieces of the coastline but are not parts of the coastline result. This is done by using an Update Cursor on <FOLDER_NAME>_SPLIT to remove any lines that have a Shape Length of longer than 40. This is an arbitrary number and should probably be tweaked.
3. Now, the goal is to merge line segments together that are connected. To do this, a buffer is created around each line segment using the Buffer tool. A buffer of 2 metres is used, which is, again, an arbitrary number but works. It could be tweaked. The resulting buffer called <FOLDER_NAME>_BUFFER is then dissolved using the Dissolve tool according to any overlapping buffers, meaning buffers that are close to each other will be dissolved into one and given an ID. Using the Spatial Join tool, the line segments and the dissolved buffers are joined, resulting in the line segments each being associated with one of the dissolved buffers. The result is <FOLDER_NAME>_SPATIAL_JOIN. By dissolving this spatial join result using the Dissolve tool, we end up with the desired result in <FOLDER_NAME>_RESULT.

### 4.3 - OUTPUTS
The outputs of the script are multiple Feature Classes:
- <FOLDER_NAME>_<NUMBER> (one for each processed GeoJSON file)
- <FOLDER_NAME>_MERGE
- <FOLDER_NAME>_SPLIT
- <FOLDER_NAME>_BUFFER
- <FOLDER_NAME>_DISSOLVE
- <FOLDER_NAME>_SPATIAL_JOIN
- <FOLDER_NAME>_RESULT

## 5 - NEXT PHASE
This section outlines current issues, improvements to be made, exploration to be done, more code to write, as well as ideas that could be considered beyond the scope of the current project.

### 5.1 - ISSUES
- The fishnet should be tweaked to remove polygons that don't include coastline. (1.4)
- Some polygon results include extra images that interfere with the coastline results. (3.3)
- There are data gaps along diagonal lines/in a triangular area that need to be investigated. (3.4)
- Some image edges are detected as shorelines. (3.5)
- Lakes need to be removed from the results.

### 5.2 - IMPROVEMENTS - FOR REVIEW
#### `Prepare_GeoJSON_NFLD.py`
##### 1. Improved error and exception messaging and segmentation:
- Identify critical sections of your code where exceptions might occur.
- Use try-except blocks to catch specific exceptions in those sections.
- Provide informative error messages that explain the issue and how to resolve it.
- Consider using custom exceptions to handle specific scenarios, making error handling more precise.
##### 2. User input validation:
- Define the expected format and valid ranges for each user input.
- Use functions to validate user inputs against these criteria.
- Continuously prompt the user until valid input is provided.
- Handle potential edge cases or unexpected input to prevent program crashes.
##### 3. Add a logger to allow for logging filters and writing output to a document instead of the console:
- Import the Python logging module to use for logging purposes.
- Set up a logger with desired log level and file handler (for writing logs to a file).
- Use logging statements throughout your code to record important events and information.
- Customize the log format to include relevant details such as timestamp and log level.
- Optionally, add logging filters to control which log records are emitted based on specific criteria.
##### 4. Add more logging statements that create more of a dialog and explanation as the program runs:
- Insert logging statements before and after significant steps or functions.
- Use logging to display the state of variables or important calculations.
- Add explanatory log messages to guide users and developers through the program's execution.
##### 5. Set some of the CoastSat settings with user inputs:
- Identify which CoastSat settings can be controlled by users.
- Ask users for input or provide command-line arguments to specify these settings.
- Update the relevant parts of your code to use the user-provided settings.
##### 6. Add an option to delete files only needed in intermediate steps:
- Determine which intermediate files can be safely deleted.
- Implement a flag or input option that allows users to choose whether to perform file cleanup.
- Provide a warning before deleting any files to prevent accidental data loss.
- Implement the file cleanup functionality at the end of the program or after the user-specified steps.

#### `Prepare_GeoJSON_PEI.py`
- All above improvements including
- It is picking up the cooridnates and number of polygons to process in the csv., but not processing them with the satelitte imagery. 

`Process_GeoJSON.py`
- User input validation.
- Improve performance.

Other:
- Use tools to triage the fishnet polygons into subsets by date.
